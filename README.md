ðŸŽŒ Codespace for developing an executable with foundation-developer

This project sets up a github codespace. In that codespace there is
a mulle-objc project of a simple executable.

The project is build with [mulle-objc](//mulle-objc.github.io/) and the 
[MulleFoundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation).

## How To

### Create Codespace

If you have Codespaces enabled on Github, you should see the "Create Codespaces on master" button.

**Beware**, the preparation of the Codespace can take a few minutes. 
Also check the github pricing, as Codespaces may encur costs (post-beta).

### Debug Project

Once the container has been built, you will be in a Visual Studio Code environment, running in your 
browser. You can now build and debug the project:
