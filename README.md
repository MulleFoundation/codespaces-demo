ðŸŽŒ Codespace for developing an executable with foundation-developer

This project sets up a github codespace to create an executable,
which is build with [mulle-objc](//mulle-objc.github.io/) and the 
[MulleFoundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation).

Beware: The preparation of the codespace can take a few minutes.

[mulle-gdb](//github/mulle-cc/mulle-gdb) is not included and must
be build manually.
